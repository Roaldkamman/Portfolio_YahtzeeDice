 YahtzeeDice

This project let's you play Yahtzee without physical dice!

I'm using JQuery and bootstrap but most of the CSS styling is done custom.

As always this is a mobile-first responsive design. 

This is the first project where I'm keeping track of my activities and documenting my code correctly using comments. This will be standard practice for me from now on.
