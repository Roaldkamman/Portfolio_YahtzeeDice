 YahtzeeDice

This project let's you play Yahtzee without physical dice!

I'm using JQuery and bootstrap but most of the CSS styling is done custom.

As always this is a mobile-first responsive design. 

This is the first project where I'm keeping track of my activities and documenting my code correctly using comments. This will be standard practice for me from now on.

I used aspects of the brand to color and design the page. Their theme involves a lot of Green so I chose to color the background that color and use different shades of green for the main color theme. I might include some red later on but whenever I tested that it looked like a Christmas theme. It didn't fit the brand image.
