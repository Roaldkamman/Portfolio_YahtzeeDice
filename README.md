 YahtzeeDice

This project let's you play Yahtzee without physical dice!

I'm using JQuery and bootstrap but most of the CSS styling is done custom.

As always this is a mobile-first responsive design. 

This is the first project where I'm keeping track of my activities and documenting my code correctly using comments. This will be standard practice for me from now on. I have worked the logging and documenting into my project workflow by doing it every time I make 3-5 changes to the project. 

I used aspects of the brand to color and design the page. Their theme involves a lot of Green so I chose to color the background that color and use different shades of green for the main color theme. I might include some red later on but whenever I tested that it looked like a Christmas theme. It didn't fit the brand image.

commit to GitHub.

End of activities 03/07/2020. (Side note:) I Think I can make the functionality of the site even simpler by combining the roll 1-5 buttons and showing as many random numbers as clicked in one line. This will be my first objective the next time I work on this project. After that I will resize the app for larger screens. Although I did get a minimum viable product ready here within 48 hours. Also the buttons need better styling. I will add some padding in CSS tomorrow to make them look and feel more appealing. 

Monday 03/09/2020: 

All activities in order of completion.

As mentioned previously in a note I edited the HTML and JavaScript so that now there are 5 buttons that generate the right amount of generated numbers depending on the button clicked. The base state of the site there are 5 0's as placeholders for the generated numbers. 

Documented the JavaScript using comments.

Imported font from google.

Adjusted mobile-first CSS text font-sizes for new font. 

Edited and optimized CSS for buttons. 

Summary so far: Site is half the size with the same amount of functionality. Site is more accassible, and has fully optimized CSS for mobile design. 

Before adding in larger breakpoints and optimizing the site for larger screens I want to try and add in extra functionality using JavaScript. I'm thinking of an input field that remembers the generated numbers you clicked on. So that when a player rolls 5 dices he can keep 2 by clicking on the numbers and they would be added to the input field so they are easy to remember. 

Commit to Github. 

Fixed the id attribute of the #dice ID so that the navigation points to the correct section of the website. 

Commit to GitHub. Time for break. 

Tried building the new functionality interactive notepad but ran into an issue. Asked a more experienced friend for help. Here is a link to a video containing a detailed description of the issue: https://www.loom.com/share/c8171d2516cb4620a9d616ce31b6eed1

Commit to GitHub since nothing has functionally changed in the app for a user. There is unfinished JS work in progress.
